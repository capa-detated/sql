## Section 1:
You can start this section following *session 1*, but you may want to wait until you feel comfortable wtih basic SQL query writing. 

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Design a logical data model
- Duplicate the logical data model and add another table to it following the instructions
- Write, within this markdown file, an answer to Prompt 3


###  Design a Logical Model

#### Prompt 1
Design a logical model for a small bookstore. 📚

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. 

Additionally, include a date table. 

There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) or [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

**HINT:** You do not need to create any data for this prompt. This is a conceptual model only. 

#### Prompt 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

#### Prompt 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2? 

**HINT:** search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions. 

```
To save customer addresses, we have two options: save only the most recent address on record, or save every address each customer has ever recorded.
Type 1 slowly changing dimension architecture overwrites existing data when a field is updated, so this would be the appropraite strategy if we only need the current address and don't care about tracking address changes of customers. However, if we want the table to preserve every address that each customer has ever recorded, we would want to implement Type 2 architecture, as this type allows us to save all entries. Using Type 2, we would then want to add an additional 'flag' column (or timestamp) to indicate which entry is currently 'active'. 
```

## Section 2:
You can start this section following *session 4*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment2.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment2.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question


### Write SQL

#### COALESCE
1. Our favourite manager wants a detailed long list of products, but is afraid of tables! We tell them, no problem! We can produce a list with all of the appropriate details. 

Using the following syntax you create our super cool and not at all needy manager a list:
```
SELECT 
product_name || ', ' || product_size|| ' (' || product_qty_type || ')'
FROM product
```

But wait! The product table has some bad data (a few NULL values). 
Find the NULLs and then using COALESCE, replace the NULL with a blank for the first problem, and 'unit' for the second problem. 

**HINT**: keep the syntax the same, but edited the correct components with the string. The `||` values concatenate the columns into strings. Edit the appropriate columns -- you're making two edits -- and the NULL rows will be fixed. All the other rows will remain the same.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### Windowed Functions
1. Write a query that selects from the customer_purchases table and numbers each customer’s visits to the farmer’s market (labeling each market date with a different number). Each customer’s first visit is labeled 1, second visit is labeled 2, etc. 

You can either display all rows in the customer_purchases table, with the counter changing on each new market date for each customer, or select only the unique market dates per customer (without purchase details) and number those visits. 

**HINT**: One of these approaches uses ROW_NUMBER() and one uses DENSE_RANK().

2. Reverse the numbering of the query from a part so each customer’s most recent visit is labeled 1, then write another query that uses this one as a subquery (or temp table) and filters the results to only the customer’s most recent visit.

3. Using a COUNT() window function, include a value along with each row of the customer_purchases table that indicates how many different times that customer has purchased that product_id.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### String manipulations
1. Some product names in the product table have descriptions like "Jar" or "Organic". These are separated from the product name with a hyphen. Create a column using SUBSTR (and a couple of other commands) that captures these, but is otherwise NULL. Remove any trailing or leading whitespaces. Don't just use a case statement for each product! 

| product_name               | description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| Habanero Peppers - Organic | Organic     |

**HINT**: you might need to use INSTR(product_name,'-') to find the hyphens. INSTR will help split the column. 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### UNION
1. Using a UNION, write a query that displays the market dates with the highest and lowest total sales.

**HINT**: There are a possibly a few ways to do this query, but if you're struggling, try the following: 1) Create a CTE/Temp Table to find sales values grouped dates; 2) Create another CTE/Temp table with a rank windowed function on the previous query to create "best day" and "worst day"; 3) Query the second temp table twice, once for the best day, once for the worst day, with a UNION binding them.

## Section 3:
You can start this section following *session 5*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment2.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment2.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question

### Write SQL

#### Cross Join
1. Suppose every vendor in the `vendor_inventory` table had 5 of each of their products to sell to **every** customer on record. How much money would each vendor make per product? Show this by vendor_name and product name, rather than using the IDs.

**HINT**: Be sure you select only relevant columns and rows. Remember, CROSS JOIN will explode your table rows, so CROSS JOIN should likely be a subquery. Think a bit about the row counts: how many distinct vendors, product names are there (x)? How many customers are there (y). Before your final group by you should have the product of those two queries (x\*y). 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### INSERT
1. Create a new table "product_units". This table will contain only products where the `product_qty_type = 'unit'`. It should use all of the columns from the product table, as well as a new column for the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.  Name the timestamp column `snapshot_timestamp`.

2. Using `INSERT`, add a new row to the product_unit table (with an updated timestamp). This can be any product you desire (e.g. add another record for Apple Pie). 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### DELETE 
1. Delete the older record for the whatever product you added.

**HINT**: If you don't specify a WHERE clause, [you are going to have a bad time](https://imgflip.com/i/8iq872).

<div align="center">-</div>

#### UPDATE
1. We want to add the current_quantity to the product_units table. First, add a new column, `current_quantity` to the table using the following syntax.
```
ALTER TABLE product_units
ADD current_quantity INT;
```

Then, using `UPDATE`, change the current_quantity equal to the **last** `quantity` value from the vendor_inventory details. 

**HINT**: This one is pretty hard. First, determine how to get the "last" quantity per product. Second, coalesce null values to 0 (if you don't have null values, figure out how to rearrange your query so you do.) Third, `SET current_quantity = (...your select statement...)`, remembering that WHERE can only accommodate one column. Finally, make sure you have a WHERE statement to update the right row, you'll need to use `product_units.product_id` to refer to the correct row within the product_units table. When you have all of these components, you can run the update statement.

### Ethics

Read: Boykis, V. (2019, October 16). _Neural nets are just people all the way down._ Normcore Tech. <br>
    https://vicki.substack.com/p/neural-nets-are-just-people-all-the

**What are the ethical issues important to this story?**

Consider, for example, concepts of labour, bias, LLM proliferation, moderating content, intersection of technology and society, ect. 

```

Vicki Boykis' piece “Neural Nets Are Just People” lifts the curtain on the unseen workforce that underpins modern AI systems. Although these technologies promise innovative solutions and algorithmic efficiency, their success relies on large pools of human labourers who annotate and moderate content. Many of these workers live in regions with weaker regulations and limited healthcare access, shouldering not only the intense psychological burden of filtering potentially traumatic materials but also the financial strain that comes with inadequate social protections. Such difficult conditions, amplified by global socio-economic disparities, deepen the invisibility of the people who make AI possible.

This disparity is nothing new. As Boykis noted, Dr. Fei-Fei Li’s groundbreaking work on ImageNet, for instance, involved crowdsourced labor for image classification because American university students failed to live up to the task. Thousands of low-paid annotators, many working remotely from developing countries, laboured to feed meticulously labeled data into the nascent field of computer vision. Although the resulting database propelled AI research forward, the individuals who labeled each image remained unacknowledged and underpaid, setting a precedent that persists across today’s AI enterprises. On top of this, the article points to the biases that creeps into AI systems when the human workers labeling data are not offered adequate training or fair working conditions. Precarious employment structures may force annotators to rush through tasks, lean on stereotypes, or rely on simplistic assumptions. These rushed decisions then become encoded in the models that drive everyday applications, perpetuating harmful cultural and societal biases. These systemic issues question the promise of AI as a great equalizer, suggesting instead that it will exacerbate harmful power structures if the status quo persists.

Alongside these labor concerns, the rapid expansion of AI applications raises further ethical questions. Large Language Models now permeate everyday life in the form of chatbots and content generators. Yet LLMs are only one dimension of a broad array of AI use cases. Law enforcement agencies increasingly rely on image recognition software to identify suspects, a practice that is known to lead to false arrests based on biased underlying models. Meanwhile, the automation of jobs, ranging from warehouse fulfillment to customer service, threatens to displace workers without providing clear pathways for financial resilience. Even in areas where technology claims to foster connection, such as personalized social media feeds, the result can be greater isolation; by filtering our interactions to echo existing preferences, AI-driven recommendation engines herd us into digital silos, diminishing the sense of shared community and healthy civic discourse.

All of these developments underscore the need for holistic ethical standards that address labor rights, privacy, bias, and transparency. It seems that we cannot neatly disentangle the pressing concerns around the treatment of hidden AI workers from the broader social ramifications of expanding AI capabilities. Governments, private companies, research institutions, and consumers all bear responsibility, though not equally, for ensuring that AI’s benefits are not purchased at the expense of human well-being. Ultimately, the call to see “neural nets as people” isn’t just a metaphor for how these systems function; it’s a call to recognize the very real human labor and social implications woven into the foundation of modern AI technology.
